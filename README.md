# RemoveBackground
Remove Background for every photo in a folder using photoshop

This python script will remove all backgrounds photos in a given folder and place them into any directory that you choose

Installation/Change

Change the Source folder and change the output folder path, make sure to include the full path for it to work. 


*Note sometimes it gets hungup on some images and some complex images will not turn out correctly so make sure to backup your images prior to running that way if you have an image that does not turn out perfectly then you can manually remove the background.
